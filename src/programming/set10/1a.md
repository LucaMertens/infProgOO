## Enumeration
An enumeration contains a number of constants and may offer methods to work with these constants (e.g. compare). Enumerations are a special type of class, which is always static and final.
## Assertion
An assertion validates an assumption (in the form of a boolean-expression) about one's program.
Assertions can be used to validate the functionality of code, while also documenting it.
As opposed to exceptions, assertions are not to be used to indicate user-error, but rather as a debugging-method for the programmer, which is why they can be disabled alltogether.

_Example:_
```java
assert flag: "If flag == false, this string will be shown with the thrown error."
```
## Precondition / Postcondition
Preconditions are used to check whether something is true before a computation occurs.
Example: Using an assertion to check whether input-arguments are in a valid range for a method.

Postconditionas are used to check whether something is true after a computation.
Example: Using an assertion to check whether the return value of a method is in a valid range.
## Invariant
An invariant is a condition that must be true at a certain point during a computation.
Example: Using assertions to check whether a calculated value within a method is in an expected range.

## Method / object decomposition
