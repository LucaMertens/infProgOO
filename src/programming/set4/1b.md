## Method

A method is a named set of instructions (statements) that can be reused within a program.

## Formal and actual parameters

**Formal parameters** (often just called parameters) are variables that are declared within method declarations.
Example:

```java
public void someMethod = (int n) {} //n is a formal param.
```

Actual parameters (arguments) are expressions assigned to formal parameters of a method. They can be different for every method call.
Example:

```java
someMethod(5); //5 is an actual param.
someMethod(1337); //1337 is an actual param
```

## Type

The type of a variable defines the "shape" of that variables value.<br>
This can be either in the form of primitive data types (eg. int, boolean) or non-primitive data types (eg. String, MyClass).

The type of a method denotes the type of that methods return value.

## Scope

The scope of a variable is the part of the program where that variable can be accessed.

## Control flow statement

Normally, java programs execute "line after line".<br>
Control flow statements can be used to change that _flow_ of the program, for example through loops (eg. for, while) or conditionals (eg. if, switch).
